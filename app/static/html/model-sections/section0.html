                        Machine Learning, particularly through innovations like GraphCast, is transforming weather
                        forecasting by leveraging vast data sets to predict complex weather patterns, outperforming
                        traditional deterministic models. Unlike conventional methods that rely on fixed equations, ML
                        models like GraphCast analyze historical and current data to uncover hidden patterns, offering
                        more
                        accurate and dynamic forecasts. This capability is especially crucial for predicting extreme
                        weather
                        events, where traditional models fall short. The success of ML in this domain not only
                        represents a
                        leap forward in predictive accuracy but also highlights the potential for significant
                        advancements
                        in fields reliant on weather forecasting, underscoring the growing importance of data-driven
                        approaches in understanding and predicting natural phenomena. We will start with some more
                        traditional statistical models and identify their weaknesses, then move onto machine learning
                        models.</p>

                        To explore this website, use the section buttons at the bottom of each section and the graph
                        navigation buttons. You can always hover over a block of text if you are not sure which graph
                        you should be looking at. The ones with relevant graphs will appear green for you to click on
                        and it will direct you to the relevant graph.
