                <h1>Linear Regression</h2>
                    <p>Linear regression is a statistical method utilized for predicting a dependent variable, such as a
                        specific weather condition, based on one or more independent variables. It aims to establish a
                        linear relationship between these variables, providing a straightforward approach to forecasting
                        weather phenomena like temperature, humidity, or precipitation levels based on historical data
                        and
                        trends.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Pros:
                    </h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Simplicity:</b> Models are straightforward to understand and
                            interpret</li>
                        <li><b>Speed:</b> Linear regression models are quick to develop and require less computational
                            resources than more complex models</li>
                        <li><b>Establishes Relationships:</b> Helpful in understanding how various weather factors are
                            linearly related to each other</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Cons:</h2>


                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Linearity:</b> Assumes a linear relationship between variables, which may not accurately
                            reflect complex weather dynamics</li>
                        <li><b>Over-simplification:</b> Might not capture intricate patterns, interactions, or
                            non-linear
                            relationships present in weather data.</li>
                        <li><b>Assumptions:</b> Requires that residuals (errors) be normally distributed and
                            independent,
                            which often doesn't hold true in weather data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We'll start by setting up the basic framework needed to perform a Linear Regression analysis.
                        This involves preparing our data, understanding the relationship between our independent
                        (predictor) and dependent (outcome) variables, and learning how to interpret the results our
                        model provides us.</p>
                    <span class="code-subtext">// Importing necessary libraries</span>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error</pre></code>

                    <p>
                        Our first example will include temperature range data from a weather station in Ithaca from
                        2010-2024.
                        This isn't a lot of data, but as you will see, we can still make meaningful predictions of the
                        temperature. We will start with the lag-1 daily maximum temperature, meaning the previous day's
                        temperature, as our feature to
                        predict the daily maximum temperature.
                    </p>
                    <span class="code-subtext">// A sample of our data</span>

                    <span class="code-subtext">// Importing data, converting to datetime, and creating lag
                        feature</span>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">df = pd.read_csv('data/data1.csv')
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)          

df['Tmax_lag1'] = df['Tmax'].shift(1)
df['Tmin_lag1'] = df['Tmin'].shift(1)
df.dropna(inplace=True) # We remove the NaN values created by introducing the lag feature </pre></code>
                    <p>
                        We will now setup a training set and a testing set. Separating data into training and test sets
                        allows for the evaluation of a model's performance on unseen data, ensuring it generalizes well
                        beyond the data it was trained on. For time series, data is chronologically ordered, so we split
                        based on time to maintain that. Commonly, a final section of a time series dataset is left for
                        testing. Let's select the last 60 days.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">num_days = 60
train_df = df[:-num_days]
test_df = df[-num_days:]

X_train = train_df[['Tmax_lag1']] # X is our feature(s)
y_train = train_df['Tmax'] # y is our dependent variable
X_test = test_df[['Tmin_lag1']] 
y_test = test_df['Tmax']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)</pre></code>
